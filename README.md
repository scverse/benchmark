# benchmark machine

## Development plan:

1. [MVP](https://github.com/scverse/benchmark/milestone/1): 

   Queue and runs exist on the benchmark server, which handles everything

2. [Dedicated queue](https://github.com/scverse/benchmark/milestone/2)

   To avoid a web server running in the background, have a VM or so that maintains the queue

3. [Cancellation](https://github.com/scverse/benchmark/milestone/3)

   Improve UX by allowing cancellation and other niceties
